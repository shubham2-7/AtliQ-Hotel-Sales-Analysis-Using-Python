# -AtliQ-Hotels-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
**🚀 AtliQ Hotels Data Analysis Project Using Python 🏨🐍📊**



I recently worked on an exciting data analysis project focused on AtliQ Hotels, where I leveraged Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) to extract valuable business insights from hotel booking data.

Here’s how I approached the project using a structured data analytics workflow:



🔹 **1. Data Import & Extraction**

➡️ Loaded data from multiple sources: bookings, hotels, rooms, and dates

➡️ Used pandas (read_csv(), read_excel()) for efficient data handling



🔹 **2. Data Cleaning**

➡️ Removed duplicates, handled missing values (dropna(), fillna())

➡️ Standardized date formats and corrected inconsistent data entries

➡️ Filtered out irrelevant records for better accuracy



🔹 **3. Data Transformation**

➡️ Merged datasets to create a unified view of hotel performance

➡️ Engineered new features like occupancy percentage, revenue per room

➡️ Applied grouping (groupby()) and aggregations for deeper analysis



🔹**4. Insights Generation**

➡️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

📊 Booking Trends – Identified peak and off-season trends

💰 Revenue Distribution – Found top revenue-generating hotels

🌍 Occupancy Rates – Compared room utilization across cities

➡️ Visualized insights using Matplotlib & Seaborn for clear storytelling



**🚀 Key Business Insights**

🔹 Identified high-performing booking platforms

🔹 Discovered seasonal trends to optimize pricing strategies

🔹 Found top revenue-generating cities, helping AtliQ Hotels improve decision-making



This project strengthened my skills in data wrangling, visualization, and business insights generation reinforcing how data-driven strategies can enhance hotel operations!
